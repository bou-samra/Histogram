# Histogram

what is a histogram?
The visual representation that charts the frequency distribution of variables in a data set.
A frequency distribution shows the regularity of an occurrence of a value in a set of data.
Often confused with a bar chart, although there are certain defining characteristics of differentiation.
* The x-axis consists of equal width bars without space in between, known as bins or buckets that represent a range of classes.
* x axis is the class interval and is labelled with a number rather than a description.
* The y axis represents the frequency of occurrence of a value.
* Bar graphs represents data that is discrete or categorical in nature

Uses
In statistics to show the frequency of a specific value within a certain range.
Used to analyse large amounts of data easily to detect trends and patterns.
