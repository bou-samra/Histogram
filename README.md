# Histogram

What is a histogram?

The visual representation that charts the frequency distribution of variables in a data set.
A frequency distribution shows the regularity of an occurrence of a value in a set of data.
Often confused with a bar chart, although there are certain defining characteristics of differentiation.
* The x-axis consists of equal width bars without space in between, known as bins or buckets that represent a range of classes.
* x axis is the class interval and is labelled with a number rather than a description.
* The y axis represents the frequency of occurrence of a value.
* Bar graphs represents data that is discrete or categorical in nature

Uses
In statistics to show the frequency of a specific value within a certain range.
Used to analyse large amounts of data easily to detect trends and patterns. 

## Change-log:

* 06/04/2023 - Initial release
* 04/04/2023 - Foundation code

## Compilation
type `make` or `cc -o histo histogram.c -lm` on the command line

## Misc.
I have included both uniform and gaussian (normal) distribution data files.
Gnuplot or some equivelant application is required to graph the histogram data.


## Todo
* Need to use SDL2 to plot a graph of the output
* Logical bugs still exit, this is very much still a work in progress.
